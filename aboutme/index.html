        <h4>
            James 1:5-6
        </h4>
        <h5>
            "5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; 
            and it shall be given him.
            6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind
             and tossed."
        </h5>
        <h4>
            President Dieter F. Uchtdorf
        </h4>
        <h5>
            "Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters—my dear friends—please, first doubt your doubts before you doubt your
             faith.8 We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that
              come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ."
